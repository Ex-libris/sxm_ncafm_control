# dde_client.py
"""
DDE client bridge for SXM control.

This module acts as a thin bridge between the GUI and the SXM software,
translating Python method calls into Pascal-like commands that SXM expects.

DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) is a Windows protocol that allows programs to
communicate with each other. The SXM software acts as a DDE server, accepting
commands in Pascal syntax (like "ScanPara('Edit23', 0.080);").

The module also maintains a "last written" cache so the GUI can show the most recent
values, even in cases where the underlying SXM system is write-only (you can send
parameters but not read them back).

Public API:
    - send_scanpara(edit_code: str, value: float) -> None
    - send_dncpara(index: int, value: float) -> None
    - last_written(ptype: str, pcode: str) -> float | None

class BaseDDE:

    Base class providing shared functionality for both real and mock DDE clients.

    This class implements the common caching functionality that both the real
    SXM connection and the offline simulator need. It uses the template pattern:
    the base class handles caching, while subclasses implement the actual
    communication (either real DDE or console logging).

    Responsibilities:
        - Store a cache of the last parameters written
        - Provide a consistent interface for parameter recall

        The cache uses a dictionary with tuple keys to organize parameters by
        type and code. This allows the GUI to retrieve the last value sent to
        any parameter, which is essential since SXM parameters are typically
        write-only.

        Cache key format:
            (ptype, pcode) where:
            - ptype: "EDIT" for scan parameters, "DNC" for NC-AFM parameters
            - pcode: "Edit23" for scan params, "4" for DNC index

            ("EDIT", "Edit23"): 0.080  # Amplitude reference
            ("DNC", "4"): 0.050        # Drive amplitude
